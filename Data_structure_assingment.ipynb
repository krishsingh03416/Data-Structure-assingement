The primary difference lies in their mutability: lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified, added, or removed, while tuples are immutable and cannot be changed after creation. Lists are defined using square brackets ([]), whereas tuples use parentheses (()). Because of their immutability, tuples are generally faster and more memory-efficient than lists, making them ideal for fixed or constant data. Additionally, tuples can be hashable (if all their elements are hashable), allowing them to be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets, whereas lists cannot be hashed. Lists provide more built-in methods, such as append() and remove(), for modifying their contents, while tuples only offer basic methods like count() and index(). In practice, lists are used for dynamic data that may need frequent updates, while tuples are preferred for static data that should remain constant.\n",
